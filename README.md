How the System Works

The system displays all available bus routes.

Users select a route and then choose boarding and destination stops.

The system calculates the total distance between stops.

It estimates travel time using an average bus speed of 55 km/h.

A random next bus arrival time is generated for simulation.

A complete travel summary is displayed including distance, estimated time, and next bus arrival.

Python Concepts Used

Variables, lists, and dictionaries
